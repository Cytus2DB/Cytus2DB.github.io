1
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.000
{\a6}Leo：From the bottom of our hearts, we promise that from here on out

2
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.700
It's already been three months since the crisis that Vanessa threatened the world with was averted...

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.000
{\a6}Leo：we will not use ancient technology behind closed doors

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.200
A.R.C. stated that they would abolish the Library's facilities

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.200
{\a6}Leo：and will be transparent with all the content of our research 

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.800
and use other types of server technology to replace the operations of the virtual internet

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.700
{\a6}Leo：by making it available to the public

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.900
{\a6}Leo：Starting today, we will implement serious changes to our internal structure

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.300
{\a6}Leo：For the development of society and humanity

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.700
Of course, lots of people found this unacceptable and denounced the organization

11
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.300
{\a6}Leo：we will seriously reconsider our position in society and the direction we are headed...

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.250
Especially those who lost their loved ones as a result of what happened

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.500
But after a period of time most people returned to their normal lives

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.700
Time gradually diluted all that had occurred

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.500
After graduating from university, NEKO became a professional streamer musician

16
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.000
Besides her normal content of music, games and random gossip

17
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.000
{\a6}NEKO#ΦωΦ：Yo-ho! NEKO's here!

18
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.850
she also started a new series

19
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.800
where she actively goes out to help the victims that were affected by Vanessa

20
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.500
{\a6}Victim：We don't need help from you internet addicts. Please, go away...

21
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.400
Although she is constantly rejected, she never gives up

22
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.100
She used money she made from her music and streams to set up a foundation

23
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.200
that donates to the people affected and related illnesses

24
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
Xenon started playing with a band again and got back on the stage to perform

25
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.500
NEKO can always be seen among the crowd

26
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.400
{\a6}NEKO#ΦωΦ：Not bad~!

27
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.250
As for Xenon's sister Shannon,

28
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.700
she gradually shed the effect that the virtual internet had on her

29
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.900
and her condition started to improve

30
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.250
A.R.C. kept begging Xenon to return

31
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.700
But no matter how generous their offers were, no matter what position they promised

32
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.650
Xenon refused to accept

33
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.550
After the dissolution of Baro,

34
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.800
the position of JOE's bar in the inner circles grew higher and higher

35
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.700
JOE's way of doing things became more and more like Saxon's

36
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.700
Mr. Neumann decided to move to Node 13,

37
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.400
continuing to research the unsolved mysteries of his ancestors with Sasha

38
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.700
Humanity was still curious about ancient technology and yearned to learn more

39
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.300
The missions of A.R.C.'s Exploration Team continued

40
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.100
{\a6}ConneR：Oh? You again?

41
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.000
{\a6}ConneR：Keep up the hard work

42
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.500
Rin was able to break free of A.R.C.'s control,

43
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.500
concealing her Architect identity and living with Sagar

44
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.500
She also returned to Node 03 to look for her past memories

45
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.000
{\a6}Rin：Ah! Oh...

46
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.500
{\a6}Rin：I'm s-so sorry!

47
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.400
{\a6}Rin：Wah!

48
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.800
{\a6}Daigo：Chief, here's the part you asked for

49
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.300
Nora returned to Kyuu Hou Kai and led research in various fields of medicine

50
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.650
{\a6}Nora：Thank you, just put it there

51
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.800
all the while trying to repair ROBO_Head

52
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.100
{\a6}Nora："NORA"

53
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.550
Helena was unable to accept the loss of PAFF and Noah, remaining mired in sorrow,

54
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.000
all alone

55
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.150
Hayato remained in the "music world", as promised,

56
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.000
missing Kaori through music

57
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.350
Though sorrow and regret remains,

58
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.000
everyone is still working hard to live their lives

59
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:24.350
The world still turns,

60
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.850
just as before.
