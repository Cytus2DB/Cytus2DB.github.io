00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.600
Xenon：Damnit! Can't open it.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.600
Xenon：Hey! Is anyone there!?

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.800
Xenon：The backup lighting is still on... Only the main power source is dead, is it?

4
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.800
Cherry：... Ugh...

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.500
Xenon：Sherry!? Are you awake?

6
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.300
Xenon：So this means that the entire life support system has stopped functioning...?

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.300
Cherry：Haa... I feel... awful...

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.500
Xenon：Hang in there. I'll call someone here right away!

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.000
Xenon：My device is also outside, or else I would've had a chance to hack this door open...

10
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.600
Xenon：What exactly is going on?

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.000
Cherry：Haah...

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.200
Xenon：Sherry, are you alright?

13
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.600
Cherry：... Can you come closer? I want you... by my side.

14
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.400
Xenon：... Yeah.

15
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.200
Cherry：Feels like... I had a really weird dream...

16
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:17.000
Cherry：... I was standing on a pitch-black water surface, constantly looking for a flower... A blue... illuminating flower.

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Cherry：Whenever I was about to touch it, it disappeared. This repeated itself, again and again...

18
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.300
Cherry：For some reason, I feel... that it's something very important. If I don't find it... I will lose everything...

19
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.200
Cherry：If I can return to the dream, maybe I'll be able to find it this time.

20
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.400
Xenon：It's just a dream.

21
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.700
Xenon：Don't fall asleep. The system should be restored very soon. Nora would never leave a situation like this unaddressed.

22
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.200
Cherry：... Yeah.

23
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.100
Cherry：I kind of understand what you meant by "let go of the past" now...

24
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.200
Cherry：Perhaps the thing I want to pursue never existed in the first place...

25
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.500
Cherry：But... you're here.

26
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.400
Xenon：... Yes, I'm here.

27
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.800
Cherry：Hey, sing "Still" for me...

28
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.900
Xenon：......

29
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.300
Cherry：Come on... it's not like there's anybody else here...

30
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.300
Xenon：... Okay.

31
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.700
Xenon：You don't have to cover yourself

32
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.500
Xenon：When no one can be trust

33
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.200
Xenon：I'm still here standing beside you

34
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.800
Xenon：But they torn us apart

35
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.500
Xenon：And I still keep you, inside my broken heart.

36
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.200
Cherry：...... Haha......

37
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.500
Cherry：... Your singing...

38
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.300
Cherry：sucks......
