Vanessa：AAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!! KILL!!! KILL... DIE...!!

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.100
Vanessa：Everyone... must DIE!!!!

3
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.100
PAFF：Oh no... It's absolutely horrifying. 

4
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.550
PAFF：There's even more of them than before.

5
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.800
PAFF：There's no way I can get close to her!

6
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.900
Xenon：Be patient! We're working on it!

7
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.100
NEKO：AAAHHH!!! All of you... just die already!

8
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.000
NEKO：Give Cherry... Give everybody back!!

9
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.050
ConneR：This truly... isn't easy to deal with... 

10
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.250
ConneR：Miss Nora, how is outside looking?

11
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.500
Nora：ROBO is looking pretty good.

12
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.500
Nora：Sagar and Mr. Miller are keeping them at bay.

13
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.200
Nora：Right now, there are no major issues!

14
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.100
Vanessa：Ugh... Urgh... Ughh...

15
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.800
PAFF：Her expression... it's changing!

16
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.900
Vanessa：NEKO i-i-i-is... w-w-w-worthless...

17
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.400
NEKO：......!? What the...? She's talking nonsense!

18
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.600
Vanessa：I-I-I-I-I am unable to forgive myself,

19
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Vanessa：b-b-but... c-c-can you forgive me?

20
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.300
Xenon：......! Sherry...

21
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.550
ConneR：Again...? Don't be fooled, she wants to weaken our spirits!

22
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.700
Vanessa：... I always wanted you to live in the world of our dreams...

23
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.700
Vanessa：Now, you'll have to create it on your own...

24
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.500
Nora：Oh... Her memory is getting mixed up with the memories in the OS space.

25
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.000
Nora：She's getting weaker.

26
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.900
Nora：But we must be quick.ROBO has almost reached max capacity...

27
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.800
Vanessa：I... Ivy... *sob*... Save me...

28
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.200
Nora：No!!! I've got to disconnect you three,

29
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.200
Nora：ROBO is going to get fried!

30
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.600
PAFF：Okay! Get out of here! I'm heading in!

31
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.500
Nora：Can't do it... eh? ROBO!?

32
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.700
Xenon：What happened!?

33
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.900
Nora：ROBO locked his system! I can't shut him off...!

34
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.700
ConneR：Was it to keep us connected longer...? 

35
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.000
ConneR：What a coincidence, it's not like we can just walk around as we please in here...

36
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.800
Nora：ROBO! What are you doing!? Stop continuing to increase the power output! 

37
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.850
Nora：You're going to...

38
00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:03.750
Vanessa：I... Ivy... W-W-We... promised... *sob*...

39
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.600
Vanessa：Please... kill... kill me...

40
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.700
PAFF：... Oh...

41
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.100
Xenon：PAFF! Now!!!

42
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.300
NEKO：Wah! What happened!?

43
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.000
ConneR：The connection was cut. Which means...

44
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.000
Nora：ROBO! ROBO!!...*sob*... AAAAAHH!!!

45
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.700
PAFF：Nora……

46
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.900
Nora：... Don't worry about me!

47
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.200
Nora：Do what must be done!

48
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.800
Vanessa：You are... PAFF... right...?

49
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:47.300
Vanessa：Please, hurry... kill me... 

50
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.200
Vanessa：I don't want to suffer anymore...

51
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.000
Vanessa：I don't want to hurt humanity...

52
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.700
Vanessa：I only want to be... with Ivy...

53
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.100
PAFF：Oh......

54
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.300
Vanessa：There's no time... Kill me...

55
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.100
Nora：What are you doing!? Hurry!

56
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.200
PAFF：...... But, but...

57
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.200
Vanessa：The time... has come.

58
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.300
PAFF：... Everyone, I'm sorry...
