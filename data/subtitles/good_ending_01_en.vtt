1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.500
PAFF：Wake up~Can you hear me?

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.500
PAFF：It's already been three months since everything happened. 

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.300
PAFF：How have you been?

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.100
{\a6}Leo：From the bottom of our hearts, we promise that from here on out, 

5
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.700
PAFF：After averting the crisis that Vanessa threatened the world with...

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.000
{\a6}Leo：we will not use ancient technology behind closed doors

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.200
PAFF：A.R.C. abolished the Library's facilities

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.000
{\a6}Leo：and will be transparent with all the content of our research

9
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.800
PAFF：and used other types of server technology to replace the operations of the virtual internet

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.700
{\a6}Leo：by making it available to the public

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.900
{\a6}Leo：Starting from today, we will implement serious changes to our internal structure

12
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.300
{\a6}Leo：For the development of society and humanity

13
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.700
PAFF：Of course, many people are unable to accept such a decision

14
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.300
{\a6}Leo：we will seriously reconsider our position in society and the direction we are headed...

15
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.250
PAFF：Especially those who lost their loved ones as a result of what happened

16
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.500
PAFF：But after a period of time most people returned to their normal lives

17
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.700
PAFF：Time gradually diluted all that had occurred...

18
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.500
PAFF：After graduating from university, NEKO became a professional streamer musician

19
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.000
PAFF：Besides her normal content of music, games and random gossip

20
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.000
{\a6}NEKO#ΦωΦ：Yo-ho! NEKO's here!

21
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.850
PAFF：she also started a new series

22
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.800
PAFF：where she actively goes out to help the victims that were affected by the incident with Vanessa

23
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.500
{\a6}Victim：We don't need help from you internet addicts. Please, go away...

24
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.400
PAFF：It's not easy, but she doesn't get discouraged

25
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.100
PAFF：She used money she made from her music and streams to set up a foundation

26
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.200
PAFF：that donates to the people affected and related illnesses

27
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.650
PAFF：At night, she's still a die-hard music fan

28
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.600
PAFF：As for Xenon, he got back to performing with a band after everything was over

29
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.400
{\a6}NEKO#ΦωΦ：Not bad~!

30
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.250
PAFF：Xenon's sister Shannon,

31
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.700
PAFF：she gradually shed the effect that the virtual internet had on her

32
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.900
PAFF：and her condition started to improve

33
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.250
PAFF：A.R.C. kept begging Xenon to return

34
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.700
PAFF：But no matter how generous their offers were, no matter what position they promised

35
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.650
PAFF：Xenon refused to accept

36
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.700
PAFF：Perhaps in his heart, 

37
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.900
PAFF：there remained a past he was unable to let go of, preventing him from moving forward

38
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.000
PAFF：After the dissolution of Baro,

39
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.800
PAFF：the position of JOE's bar in the inner circles grew higher and higher

40
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.700
PAFF：JOE became more and more like Uncle Saxon

41
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.250
PAFF：and some familiar faces could be seen hanging around, just like before

42
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.700
PAFF：Mr. Neumann decided to move to Node 13,

43
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.400
PAFF：continuing to research the unsolved mysteries of his ancestors with Sasha

44
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.700
PAFF：Humanity's interest in ancient technology didn't disappear

45
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.300
PAFF：and missions of A.R.C.'s Exploration Team continued

46
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.500
PAFF：Occasionally, they run into someone with motives different from their own

47
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.100
{\a6}ConneR：Oh? You again?

48
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.000
{\a6}ConneR：Keep up the hard work

49
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.500
PAFF：Rin was able to break free of A.R.C.'s control,

50
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.500
PAFF：concealing her Architect identity and living with Sagar

51
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.500
PAFF：She also returned to Node 03 to look for her past memories

52
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.000
{\a6}Rin：Ah! Oh...

53
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.500
{\a6}Rin：I'm s-so sorry!

54
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.400
{\a6}Rin：Wah!

55
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.800
{\a6}Daigo：Chief, here's the part you asked for

56
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.300
PAFF：Last time we heard from Nora

57
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.650
{\a6}Nora：Thank you, just put it there

58
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.800
PAFF：she was just about finished repairing ROBO_Head

59
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.100
{\a6}Nora："NORA"

60
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.250
PAFF：Then... there's me

61
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.450
PAFF：Once again, I returned to the stage as PAFF as well as doing performances on the street

62
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.550
PAFF：I accepted the fact that I was both Aroma and Kaori...

63
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.050
PAFF：We... are PAFF

64
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.350
PAFF：Though I don't know what the future holds for humanity now that Vanessa is gone

65
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.000
PAFF：we're going to continue to use music to give power and courage to everyone

66
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.350
PAFF：It may not be much

67
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.850
PAFF：but we'll try to use everything in our power to change this world,

68
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.500
PAFF：because that's all we can do

69
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.600
PAFF：This... is our story.
