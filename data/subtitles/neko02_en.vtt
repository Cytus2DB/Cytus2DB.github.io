00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Cherry：Do we wait here?

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
Xenon：Yes. Why did you accompany me here anyway?

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Cherry：Hey, I took part in the Boss fight; make sense that I get to rescue the princess, right? I want to see NEKO in person as well.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Xenon：... Princess? I say more pixie than princess.

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.500
Cherry：You are so mean~ She's a cute girl. isn't she?

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.500
Xenon：Umm... She's... unique, to say the least. Be prepared when you see her.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.500
Cherry：All this talk is making me even more interested to see her!

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Cherry：On a side note, that's a serious crowd down there at the main entrance.

9
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.300
Xenon：Reporters and fans, I presume? They've gone nuts since NEKO's release was announced.

10
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.200
Cherry：Good thing you had friends that could let us in through the back door. I thought we're gonna get stuck outside.

11
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.500
Xenon：You're exaggerating things.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Cherry：Didn't you say that the admins have been watching you closely?

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Xenon：I still have my connections over here. If not, I wouldn't know any of this in the first place.

14
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.500
Cherry：Wow, so a shut-in like you actually made "friends"...

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
Xenon：You... it's all thanks to them that the evidence I provided could actually influence the investigation.

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Xenon：... Ah, we should stop chatting here.

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.500
[>>>Fast Forward>>>]

18
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.500
Xenon：Hey. Over here.

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500
NEKO#ΦωΦ：Ehhh? Why are you the one to come and get me? Where are my dad and others?

20
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.500
Xenon： I notify them to wait at home. There are still some procedures to go through.

21
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Xenon：You probably have no idea why you are released, right?

22
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
NEKO#ΦωΦ：Dude, I don't even know why I was arrested in the first place! It's utterly ridiculous!

23
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Xenon：You don't remember, do you...? That makes it even harder to explain things clearly.

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
NEKO#ΦωΦ：...... Who's that behind you?

25
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Cherry：Hi~

26
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.500
NEKO#ΦωΦ：EHHH!? It's Cherry! OH MY ****** GOD!!!

27
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.500
Cherry：Eh? You recognize me?

28
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.500
NEKO#ΦωΦ：Of course! NEKO is a big fan of yours! Why are you here!?

29
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Xenon：She's half the reason why you could be released.

30
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500
NEKO#ΦωΦ：Huh? What does that mean? Hmm??

31
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Xenon：It's a long story... All in all, we should leave here before we get any attention. Let's go.

32
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.000
NEKO#ΦωΦ：Come on~ tell me what's going on~

33
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500
Xenon：You are so noisy... I'll tell you once we leave here.

34
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.000
Xenon：There's a **** ton of people at the main entrance ready to engulf you. Keep your head down.

35
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.000
