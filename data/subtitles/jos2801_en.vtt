00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.500
JOE：Hello, sit anywhere you like.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
Young Man：Do you have saké?

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.500
JOE：Yep, wait one sec.

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.500
JOE：Do you want it heated?

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.500
Young Man：No.

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.500
JOE：Never seen you before. Are you from the east? Node 03?

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
Young Man：Yes. Is it rare to see one around these places?

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.500
JOE：Nah, where do you think this is? It's 08, any type of people can be found here.

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
JOE：But cold saké... indeed not an order you see every day.

10
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.500
Young Man：Back home we call this "Yukihie", refreshes the brain quite well... *Gulp!*

11
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.500
JOE："Yukihie", I see...

12
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.500
Young Man：*Gulp!*

13
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.500
JOE：Jasus, slow down. If you get drunk so fast, I'm gonna be the one carrying your limp body outside.

14
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.500
JOE：I've always had a fond interest in chatting with customers from other Nodes.

15
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500
Young Man：I'm... not exactly the type who's good at chatting.

16
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.500
JOE：Haha, it's fine.

17
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500
JOE：I'm JOE, and you are?

18
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.500
Young Man：Hayato... *Gulp!*

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.500
JOE：Did you get dumped?

20
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500
Hayato：……... Why did you ask?

21
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.500
JOE：Well, a young fella with a depressed look visiting an unfamiliar bar with the sole purpose of getting trashed.

22
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
JOE：Pretty sure that means it has something to do with relationship issues... I think?

23
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Hayato：I'm... looking for a female.

24
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500
JOE：Girlfriend?

25
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.500
Hayato：More or less my childhood friend, been missing for years already... *Gulp!*

26
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.500
JOE：For years... could it be that she already... ah, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
Hayato：No need to be...I gave up a long time ago too.

28
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.500
Hayato：In Node 03, missing people usually stay missing forever. It's practically a part of everyday life.

29
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.500
Hayato：However, for some unknown reason, I just always have this feeling that she is right here in Node 08. A very powerful feeling too...*Gulp!*

30
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
JOE：... If you're looking for someone, maybe you've come to the right location.

31
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500
JOE：Not to brag about it, but this little shop really has all kinds of people visiting every day.

32
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.500
JOE：Give me some hints, maybe I can help. If you have a photo, even better.

33
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
Hayato：A photo... I always have it with me. Here.

34
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.500
JOE：Hoho, lemme take a look. Heard from folks that Node 03 is where all the cute gals are at...

35
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.500
JOE：……！

36
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.500
JOE：...... This person......
