00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.500
Miku：I... What am I singing for?

2
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.500
Miku：Ah, I see. I'm singing for everyone.

3
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Miku：That was the last song.

4
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.000
Miku：Today... No, not just today. Thank you to everyone for your support all this time.

5
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.500
Miku：When I sing on the stage for everyone, I can see everyone's happiness. That's why I can keep on singing.

6
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Miku：I'm truly... truly grateful for everyone...

7
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
Saito：Hey, what is going on? This part is not in the schedule, isn't it?

8
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500
Staff A：I don't know! The program itself just...

9
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.500
Okubo：Stop it! Now!

10
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.500
Staff B：I don't think that's a good idea... Stopping right now will make the ending of the event really abrupt...

11
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.500
Miku：Last but not least, I still want to give everyone one more song.
12
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.500
Miku：Everyone, are you willing to sing together with me?

13
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Furuhata：Hmph, so you can sing pretty well after all.

14
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.000
Miku：It's over...

15
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.500
Miku：At the very end, I am still singing for everyone.

16
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.500
Miku：That's all I asked for.

17
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.000
Miku：Thank you. Everyone, thank you so much.

18
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Miku：Thank... you.
