Helena：Don't you have to work today?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Noah：I asked for a day off.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Noah：This is PAFF's first performance after all; how could I miss it?

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Noah：I'm the man that's going to be her no.1 fan.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.500
Helena：Ewww... gross.

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.000
Helena：If her fans are like you, things are going to be troubling.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Helena：They may even harass the idol... 

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Helena：right, Aroma?

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
PAFF：Eh!? ... Ah, yeah...

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Helena：What's the matter? Are you still nervous?

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Noah：……。

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Helena：Ah, it's from Chris.

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
[Chris]	：Hi~ Just calling in for a quick reminder. Practice starts at 10.

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Helena：Got it. We are already on our way.

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.500
[Chris]：Is PAFF there?

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.000
Helena：She's right next to me. However, it seems like she's still a bit anxious...

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
[Chris]：Oh, I see. Can I talk to her for a bit?

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Helena	：OK. Aroma, it's Chris.

19
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.000
Helena	：AROMA！！！
