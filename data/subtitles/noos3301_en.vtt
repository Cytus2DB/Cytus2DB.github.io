00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.300
Nora：ROBO, when you see this message, it means you've already arrived at Node 08. 

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
Nora：I'm sorry... I couldn't go there with you.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.400
Nora：As long as you are with me, Mogura will definitely follow us there as well, no matter where we hide...

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.800
Nora：The folks at Mogura want to dispose of you. You'll never be truly safe with them constantly chasing you.

5
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:38.300
Nora：I, on the other hand, still have a lot of value to them. I am very certain that they won't harm me.

6
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:48.100
Nora：Therefore, I decide to stay here and use my ability as a bargaining chip to persuade them to no longer hold you responsible for what you did.

7
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:58.300
Nora：Ever since I created you, so many things have happened... We created music together. We talked with each other. We played games...

8
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:09.000
Nora：Whether it was the good or the bad, you were always there by my side.

9
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.800
Nora：The time I spent with you... was truly some of the happiest times in my life. Thank you. 

10
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.000
Nora：ROBO, you are a very special existence... Much more than just a simple A.I.

11
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:33.700
Nora：You have your own emotions, your own soul that was birthed from the database that is me——Nora.

12
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:46.500
Nora：Do you remember what I told you before? The spirit, the mind, the memories... All of them are proof that a "human" once existed.

13
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.400
Nora：Therefore, for someone who inherited all of the above from me, you are the proof of my existence.

14
00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.800
Nora：So, please, go pursue "your own" freedom and dreams... If you do that, it's like you're pursuing my freedom and my dreams. 

15
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:11.600
Nora：I have reconfigured your supreme command. From now on, protecting me is no longer your reason to live.

16
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.900
Nora：I also forbid you from returning to Node 03.

17
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:28.300
Nora：On behalf of me, experience more happy things. Let more people hear our music. Learn even more things...

18
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.800
Nora：Go live a life that you've yearned for. This is something you deserve.

19
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
{\a6}[Platform announcement]：The train is about to depart. For passengers who haven't board the train, please proceed to take other trains. Thank you for your cooperation.

20
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.100
Nora：.... Goodbye, ROBO_Head.
